## Introduction

This directory is dedicated to exploring Hive queries and operations. It covers a variety of topics, including database creation, table creation from different file formats (CSV, JSON), working with external and internal tables, managing partition keys and clustering keys, and diving into advanced topics such as join strategies and related properties.

## Directory Structure

- **/data-files:** Datasets used for creating different tables.
- **/python-udf-files:** Python files to define functions used as udf in hive
- **hive-commands,explanations and notes.txt:** Covered various hive related operations, queries and their output, important points and notes.
- **hive-queries.sql:** Here I have included only sql-queries and minor description for fetching queries easily.
