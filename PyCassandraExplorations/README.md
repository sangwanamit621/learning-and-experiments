## Introduction
This repository serves as a record of my experiments with Cassandra, showcasing how to perform basic operations using Python in a Jupyter notebook. From connecting to the Cassandra database to creating keyspaces, tables, and executing CRUD operations, this is your go-to guide for Cassandra basics.

## Features
- **Python-Powered:** All operations are performed using Python, making it easy for Python enthusiasts to dive in.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** The experiments are documented in a Jupyter notebook, providing an interactive and step-by-step learning experience.
- **Cassandra Operations:** Learn how to connect to Cassandra, create keyspaces and tables, insert and fetch data, work with partition and cluster keys, and more.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:
- Cassandra Database
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/learning-and-experiments.git
    ```
   
2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    -  Navigate to the `learning-and-experiments/PyCassandraExplorations` directory.
    -  Launch Jupyter notebook and open the `cassandra-operations.ipynb` file.

## Notebook Overview
Explore various experiments, including:
  -  Connecting to Cassandra
  -  Creating Keyspace and Table
  -  Fetching available Keyspaces and Tables
  -  Inserting and Fetching Data
  -  Working with Partition and Cluster Keys
  -  Executing Where Condition on Partitioned Table
    
Feel free to experiment with the provided notebook and modify it based on your learning goals.
